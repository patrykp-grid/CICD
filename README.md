### 1. What is needed to implement continuous integration and what benefits does it bring?

#### Benefits

- chance to catch mistakes in code faster (when they are small)

- reduced MTTR (mean time to resolution)

- no need to manually build or test anything

#### What is needed?

- version control tool

- CI tool (gitlab/jenkins)

### 2. What is the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?

- continuous delivery always ensures that code is ready to be published to production, while continuous deployment automates the release process

### 3. What role does test automation play in continuous delivery?

- The primary aim of CI CD automated testing is to improve the speed, efficiency, and quality of software delivery. By automating tests, teams can quickly identify and fix bugs, reduce manual effort, and accelerate the overall time to market.

### 4. What is GitOps and how is it related to CI/CD?

- GitOps is a modern software development and deployment approach where the entire infrastructure and application lifecycle is managed through Git repositories as the single source of truth.

### 5. Which open-source tools are frequently used for CI/CD automation?

Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI, Argo CD

### 6. What tools do public cloud providers (AWS, GCP, and Azure) offer for the same purpose?

#### AWS:

AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodeStar

#### GCP:

Google Cloud Build, Google Cloud Deploy, Google Cloud Source Repositories, Google Cloud Operations 

#### Azure:

Azure DevOps, Azure Pipelines, Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Artifacts
